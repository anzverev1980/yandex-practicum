<div class="markdown markdown_size_normal markdown_type_theory"><h1>Task Statement</h1><h5>It's time to deal with a real data science problem from the gold mining sector. This project is provided by <a href="https://www.zyfra.com/" target="_blank">Zyfra</a>.</h5><div class="paragraph">When you finish, send your work to the project reviewer. You will receive feedback within 24 hours. After that, you will make any necessary changes to your work and send it for a second review.</div><div class="paragraph">Usually, this process has to be repeated several times until you get the green light from the reviewer and all the corrections are approved. Thatâ€™s all part of the job.</div><div class="paragraph">Your project will be considered complete once the project reviewer approves it.</div><h2>Task statement</h2><div class="paragraph">Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.</div><div class="paragraph">The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.</div><div class="paragraph">The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.</div><div class="paragraph">You need to:</div><ol start="1"><li>Prepare the data;</li><li>Perform data analysis;</li><li>Develop and train a model.</li></ol><div class="paragraph">To complete the project, you may want to use documentation from <em>pandas</em>, <em>matplotlib,</em> and <em>sklearn.</em></div><div class="paragraph">The next lesson is about the ore purification process. You will pick the information that is important for the model development.</div></div>

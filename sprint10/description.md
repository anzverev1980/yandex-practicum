<div class="markdown markdown_size_normal markdown_type_theory"><h1>Project description</h1><div class="paragraph">The data is stored in three files:</div><ul><li><code class="code-inline code-inline_theme_light">gold_recovery_train.csv</code> — training dataset d<a href="https://code.s3.yandex.net/datasets/gold_recovery_train.csv">ownload</a></li><li><code class="code-inline code-inline_theme_light">gold_recovery_test.csv</code> — test dataset <a href="https://code.s3.yandex.net/datasets/gold_recovery_test.csv">download</a></li><li><code class="code-inline code-inline_theme_light">gold_recovery_full.csv</code> — source dataset <a href="https://code.s3.yandex.net/datasets/gold_recovery_full.csv">download</a></li></ul><div class="paragraph">Data is indexed with the date and time of acquisition (<code class="code-inline code-inline_theme_light">date</code> feature). Parameters that are next to each other in terms of time are often similar.</div><div class="paragraph">Some parameters are not available because they were measured and/or calculated much later. That's why, some of the features that are present in the training set may be absent from the test set. The test set also doesn't contain targets.</div><div class="paragraph">The source dataset contains the training and test sets with all the features.</div><div class="paragraph">You have the raw data that was only downloaded from the warehouse. Before building the model, check the correctness of the data. For that, use our instructions.</div><h2>Project instructions</h2><div class="paragraph"><strong>1. Prepare the data</strong></div><div class="paragraph">1.1. Open the files and look into the data.</div><div class="paragraph">Path to files:</div><ul><li><em>/datasets/gold_recovery_train.csv</em></li><li><em>/datasets/gold_recovery_test.csv</em></li><li><em>/datasets/gold_recovery_full.csv</em></li></ul><div class="paragraph">1.2. Check that recovery is calculated correctly. Using the training set, calculate recovery for the <code class="code-inline code-inline_theme_light">rougher.output.recovery</code> feature. Find the <em>MAE</em> between your calculations and the feature values. Provide findings.</div><div class="paragraph">1.3. Analyze the features not available in the test set. What are these parameters? What is their type?</div><div class="paragraph">1.4. Perform data preprocessing.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>2. Analyze the data</strong></div><div class="paragraph">2.1. Take note of how the concentrations of metals (<em>Au, Ag, Pb</em>) change depending on the purification stage.</div><div class="paragraph">2.2. Compare the feed particle size distributions in the training set and in the test set. If the distributions vary significantly, the model evaluation will be incorrect.</div><div class="paragraph">2.3. Consider the total concentrations of all substances at different stages: raw feed, rougher concentrate, and final concentrate. Do you notice any abnormal values in the total distribution? If you do, is it worth removing such values from both samples? Describe the findings and eliminate anomalies. </div><div class="paragraph"><strong>3. Build the model</strong></div><div class="paragraph">3.1. Write a function to calculate the final <em>sMAPE</em> value.</div><div class="paragraph">3.2. Train different models. Evaluate them using cross-validation. Pick the best model and test it using the test sample. Provide findings.</div><div class="paragraph">Use these formulas for evaluation metrics:</div><img alt="image" class="image image_expandable" src="https://pictures.s3.yandex.net/resources/smape_1576239058_1589899769.jpg">

<h1>Project evaluation</h1><div class="paragraph">We’ve put together the evaluation criteria for the project. Read this carefully before moving on to the case.</div><div class="paragraph">Here’s what the reviewers will look at when reviewing your project:</div><ul><li>Have you prepared and analyzed the data properly?</li><li>What models have you developed?</li><li>How did you check the model‘s quality?</li><li>Have you followed all the steps of the instructions?</li><li>Did you keep to the project structure and explain the steps performed?</li><li>What are your findings?</li><li>Have you kept the code neat and avoided code duplication?</li></ul><div class="paragraph">You have your takeaway sheets and summaries for previous chapters, so you are good to go.</div><div class="paragraph">Good luck!</div></div>
